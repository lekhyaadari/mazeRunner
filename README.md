# Maze Runner

### What is finished so far
1. state machine is compeltely set up in main.c
2. complex movement for the player has been established
3. collision map for the player and the grievers are completely set up.
4. sprite animation is set up but the art is not done
5. when the player reaches the end of the maze the game enters the win state however the win state uses the Instruct Background Map because I was too lazy to make a new map.
6. The heart sprites for the cheat have been implemented.

### what still needs to be finished
2. attacks for the grievers need to be implemented, the player does not die after colliding with a player
3. The grievers are not moving properly. They do not rebound off walls they kind of just get stuck there. I am not sure how to make them constantly move, I tried several different ways but nothing I tried work so I am going to keep trying.
4. being able to see the map for 5 seconds is not implemented
6. timer for the maze is also not set up
